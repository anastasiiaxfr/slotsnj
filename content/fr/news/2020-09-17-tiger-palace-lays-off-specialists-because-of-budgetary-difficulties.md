<span data-contrast="auto">Reportedly, the representatives got an email from the administration, expressing their two-year contracts were ended and would not be reappointed. Monetary troubles were refered to as the primary explanation for the cutbacks. The news stories expressed: The mail was sent to all the laborers without having any conversations or gatherings with the workers. The laborers contend that such activities are against theLabourAct. Also, the cutbacks apparently influenced just the Nepali representatives, while unfamiliar specialists proceeded with their agreement. </span><span data-ccp-props='{"134233117":true,"134233118":true,"201341983":0,"335559740":240}' />
