**Legitimate games wagering** has landed at gambling clubs and courses crosswise over **New Jersey**.

The state&#8217;s first wagers were made at 10:33 a.m. June 14, 2018, at a service held at **Monmouth Park&#8217;s William Hill Race and Sports Bar **.

After an hour, **Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa** in [Atlantic City][1] began taking wagers at an impermanent sportsbook area inside its race book. The NJ sports wagering market was off and running.

[DraftKings][2] turned into the principal organization to offer **legitimate online games wagering** in New Jersey on Aug. 6. Quite promptly, progressively online sportsbook applications entered the market in front of NFL season.

Furthermore, the market keeps on developing.

As of August 2019, there are 17 NJ online games wagering applications accessible and 10 retail sportsbooks. Here&#8217;s a rundown of the circuits and gambling clubs hopping into the NJ sports wagering market:
